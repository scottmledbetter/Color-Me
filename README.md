# Color-Me

Simple web app to visualize web colors via HEX or name input.

Text input is compared across a big ol' JS object. If input matches one of the values, the background turns that color. 

Text also turns bold, and you get the name/value pair for that color.

H A R D M O D E : You can input HEX values as well, if you want to check if a color name exists for it.
